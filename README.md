I developed a mini project in react using React Router DOM and Tailwind CSS to solidify my understanding of React Router concepts.

### Key components:
React Router DOM: Enables navigation between different views within the single-page application.
Tailwind CSS: Provides utility-first CSS classes for efficient styling.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
